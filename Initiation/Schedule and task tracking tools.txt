Typical Project Meeting:
	In Extreme Programming the main focus is put on completing the task at hand instead of planning long meetings.
	Due to that we decide to organize a short (~1 hour) meeting each week in order to evaluate the progress and set a plan for the upcoming weeks.
	Thanks to the overview of the previous week both the customer and the team can conduct a functionality test, to estimate the current state of the system. 
	Doing this on a regular basis allows us to spot and recode any mistakes.
	Planning for the next week is the main point of the meeting. 
	We will separate the tasks into short stories, which will then be implemented by the members.
